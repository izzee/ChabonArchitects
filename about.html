        <p>Founded in 1999, Arthur Chabon Architects is an award winning, full-service architecture, interior design and graphic design firm. With projects throughout the United States, ACA’s work ranges from academic and religious buildings to high-end, luxury residences. These projects include new buildings, adaptive re-use of existing buildings and both full and partial renovations.</p>
        <p>ACA’s practice is characterized by an intense focus on design and a close collaboration with their clients. The architectural language or style of their projects is never imposed or pre-conceived. Rather, it is discovered by analysis of the context, the requirements of the program, the nature of the materials, and the aspirations of their clients. The resulting building is, in a sense, revealed rather than “designed”. Listening closely to and processing the needs and aspirations of their clients is a crucial part of the design process. ACA strives to see through their clients’ eyes and to understand not just what they say they want, but what they are trying to solve. With that common understanding, that common goal, ACA can lead their clients to successful results.</p>
        <p>We are the proud recipients of the American Institute of Architect’s Faith and Form award for the Palm Beach Synagogue in Florida and the Institute of Classical Architecture and Art’s Newman Award for the Roaring Fork Compound in Aspen, Colorado.  Our projects have been published in numerous print periodicals and on-line publications including Architectural Digest, Colorado Homes, Aspen Magazine, the Huffington Post and more.</p>
