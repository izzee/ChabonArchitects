          Interior Architecture
        </p>
        <p class="project-description">
          The interior of this Aspen, Colorado home is rooted in the work of English and American craftsmen architects.
It is especially inspired by the rustic classicism of Bernard Maybeck. Designed to be comfortable and intimate for a family with young children, the interiors also had to be suitable for entertaining on a grand scale. The decorating by the late Buck Rodriguez is an eclectic mix of folk art, Arts and Crafts and classic Americana and was designed to accommodate an extensive and evolving folk art collection. As with all our work, historicism serves to bind the house to its context and provide a clear and consistent language from which to explore space and form. Unfussy, even whimsical, three centuries of design are in comfortable, casual dialogue.
